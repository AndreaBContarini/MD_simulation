# MD_simulation
This project implements a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation in C++ to study the behavior of particles interacting via the Lennard-Jones potential in a canonical ensemble (NTV). The simulation uses advanced numerical algorithms to provide accurate thermodynamic properties and validates results against published literature.
